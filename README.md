# Music-Genre-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Project on Machine Learning which classifies the genre of the music.
Music Genre Classification is a model of machine learning where different sounds are categorised in certain categories.
In this project, we will build a music Genre classification model using a machine learning algorithm known as the K-Nearest Neighbours and many other classification algorithms.

genres original - A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)
images original - A visual representation for each audio file. One way to classify data is through neural networks. Because NNs usually take in some sort of image representation, the audio files were converted to Mel Spectrograms to make this possible.
